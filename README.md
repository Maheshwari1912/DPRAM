**Aim of Dual-Port RAM**

The aim of a Dual-Port RAM is to provide simultaneous access to two different memory locations 
through two independent ports. 

This allows read and write operations to occur concurrently without interference, improving data throughput and access speed in systems where parallelism is essential. 

It is commonly used in applications such as high-speed processors, video processing, and communication systems.
